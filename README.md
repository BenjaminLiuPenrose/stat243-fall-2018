This repository holds all course materials for the fall 2018 offering of Statistics 243 at UC Berkeley.

If you're not yet familiar with Git, go to the upper right of this page and click on 'Clone or download' and then 'Download ZIP'.

## Logistics

Instructor office hours:

  - Chris: TBD
  - Omid: TBD

## Software

The `howtos` directory has information on installing and/or getting access to the software you'll need for the course. In particular, in the first week of class you'll need to get access to the UNIX command line in some fashion. See `howtos/accessingUnixCommandline.txt` for some options on how to do this. 

One way to get access to the software is to get an SCF account as follows:

  - If you are a Statistics graduate student, request an account [here](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/accounts)
  - If you are not affiliated with Statistics, get a paper form from Chris (if you are not a Statistics grad student).

## Submitting assignments

The file `howtos/submitting-electronically.txt` has information on setting up a Github repository for the class and submitting your assignments by committing your solution to Github. We'll discuss this in section on Tuesday August 28.
