# stat243-fall-2018
This repository holds all course materials for the fall 2018 offering of Statistics 243 at UC Berkeley.

## Logistics

Instructor office hours:

Chris: TBD
GSI: TBD

## Software

The `howtos` directory has information on installing and/or getting access to the software you'll need for the course. In particular, in the first week of class you'll need to get access to the UNIX command line in some fashion. See `howtos/accessingUnixCommandline.txt` for some options on how to do this. 

One way to get access to the software is to get an SCF account. This will either involve getting a paper form from Chris or requesting an account [here](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/accounts).

## Submitting assignments

The file `howtos/submitting-electronically.txt` has information on setting up a Github repository for the class and submitting your assignments by committing your solution to Github. We'll discuss this in section on Tuesday August 28.
