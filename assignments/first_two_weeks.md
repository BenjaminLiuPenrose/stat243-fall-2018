Here are the events and assignments for this week. In particular please fill
out the survey before class on Friday.

# Assignments

- (Required) By Friday at 2 pm, fill out this class survey:
https://goo.gl/forms/XYZ [UNDER CONSTRUCTION].  This is required and will be
counted as part of problem set 1.

- (Optional) If you are not comfortable with the basic UNIX usage we
saw in the first class, please work through the [UNIX basics tutorial here](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-unix-basics/archive/master.zip)
before 2 pm on Friday and answer the questions at the end. You don't need to turn anything
in. If you'd like help, please come to the install/UNIX help session listed below. 

- (Required) Please turn in, in class on Monday August 27 at 2:10 pm, answers on paper to the first
10 problems at the end of this [tutorial on using the bash shell](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-using-bash/archive/master.zip).
This is not a formal problem set, so you don't need to worry about
formatting - handwritten and just showing your code is fine. I just
want to make sure you've worked through the tutorial. You don't need
to look at all the sections in the tutorial. Please see
units/unit2-bash.pdf in the course repository for a list of the
sections you can skip over. I'll be doing demonstrations on using the
bash shell in class on Friday, so that will be helpful as you work
through the tutorial.

 - (Optional) If you are not familiar with R at the level of [modules
1-5 of the R bootcamp](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bootcamp-2017/archive/master.zip),
work through those modules and the breakout problems associated with
the modules. If you'd like help and an opportunity for extra practice,
please attend the special R catch-up session listed below. Some other
resources for R are listed at the end of module 11 of the bootcamp
materials, so you could also use those resources. You should do this
by September 4.

# Events

If you are not familiar with R at the level of
